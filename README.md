The Power BI dashboard was used to presents the analysis using different visualization tools.
### Tools Used
- Excel: This was used to analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns, to calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription types and create any other interesting reports.
- SQL: The dataset was loaded into the SQL Server environment to write and validate queries. Queries were written to extract key insights based on the following questions:
1. To retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
2. To find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
3. To find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
4. To calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
5. To find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
6. To calculate total revenue by subscription type.
7. To find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
8. To find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
- Power BI: Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends. Slicers were included for interactive analysis.
